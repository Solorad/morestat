            <p>
                We can deposit information about how your computer navigates our site onto your computer, by storing
                data files on
                it. These files are called “Cookies.” When you access our Site for the first time, a scrolling
                banner
                automatically appears at the bottom of the page. The
                presence of this banner aims to inform you about the use of Cookies by our site and to ensure that
                you
                consent to
                the presence of some of them.

                We only use three types:
            <ul>
                <li> Functional Cookies to make sure our site functions;</li>
                <li> Statistical Cookies to measure the audience on our site;</li>
                <li> Marketing Cookies, targeted marketing support, coming from third parties.</li>
            </ul>

            The marketing Cookies require your explicit consent, which is why we request your consent for them to be
            deposited
            on your computer, and on your first visit to our site.
            Browser settings can be configured to inform the User of the presence of cookies, and even to refuse
            them. It
            therefore falls to Users themselves to set their browsers to refuse cookies.

            To do that, Users may follow the following recommendations:

            For Mozilla Firefox:

            - Go to the “Tools” menu, and then to “Options”; - Click on the “Privacy” icon; - Locate the “Cookies”
            subsection
            and select the options that suit the User.

            For Microsoft Internet Explorer:

            - Go to the “Tools” menu, and then to “Internet Options”;
            - Click on the “Privacy” tab;
            - Select the preferred level using the slider.

            However, users are informed that it is possible that after having blocked cookies, certain pages on the
            Site will no
            longer be available to them.
